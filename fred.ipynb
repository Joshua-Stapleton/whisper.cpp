They're given a problem, they attempt to solve it, it's checked by the 'teacher', and if it's correct, they remember the process to solve that type of problem for the future. This system would be the same, using the autograder as the 'teacher'. It would attempt to solve the problem, the autograder would check it, and if it's correct, the solution process becomes part of the system's 'knowledge'. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, there's a crucial point to avoid what's called 'data leakage' - when the system gets information about the test dataset. To prevent this, as soon as a problem is solved correctly, it's removed from the dataset. \n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, it's a closed loop of learning, improving, and testing, but with the crucial step of not 'cheating' by using the test data to learn. The concept of 'hinge distillation' also seems to be a part of this system, although it's not elaborated on in this explanation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this sounds like a great idea that could potentially revolutionize the way systems learn and improve. It allows for continuous improvement without the need for constant human input, and with the safeguard of avoiding data leakage, it's a legitimate and fair learning process.\n",
